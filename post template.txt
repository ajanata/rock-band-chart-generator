These charts contain per-measure and cumulative scores, OD whammy beats, solo note counts, and BRE estimated upperbound scores. I expect there are still a few bugs here and there, but they are much better than nothing and the last version of my charts. :)

For the vocals, these charts contain bare-bones vocals charts. Overdrive activation zones are not marked in the .mid as they are for drums, so I suspect any gap between phrases longer than a certain amount of time (either clock time or number of beats, I'm not sure yet) is a valid activation point. I don't have time to do the needed research for this right now, but I hope to get to it Real Soon Nowâ„¢. The pitch lines are completely wonking in places, but that isn't really the point of having vocal charts. The talky part indicator characters (#, ^, and *) are left on the lyrics in case anyone wishes to do any experimenting to try to figure out what the different ones mean, if anything. A * by itself is a percussion hit (I would expect this to be rather obvious).

[b]Note:[/b] Vocal "slides" (with the slanty pitch tubes) are not drawn at all. Any time a lyric is a +, pretend that the +'s pitch tube and the previous pitch tube are connected with a slanted pitch tube. I haven't tackled how to handle this between measures yet.

A big thank you to rkcr, Revelus, and Sully for finding bugs. Thank pata70 for improvements to the vocal pitch lines. Thanks also go out to Krim and PeridotWeapon in [url=http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=3238]this thread[/url] for information about solo bonuses and Big Rock Ending scoring. Big shoutout to debr for [url=http://rockband.scorehero.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=1711]documenting Rock Band's .mid format[/url] and helping with some rounding issues.

A huge thank you to [b]Deimos[/b] for assisting with DLC.


Notes:[list]
[*]Overdrive backgrounds extend the exact range specified in the .mid file. Sometimes this is significantly shorter than the length of a sustained note (see third note in Foreplay/Long Time for example).
[*]If a solo or BRE ends at the far right of a line, the note count/bonus score can get cut off.
[*][b]The .mid BEAT track is now displayed on every chart.[/b] The game uses this to determine how long Overdrive lasts. A full bar of Overdrive always lasts for exactly 32 BEAT track beats. Most of the time this is 16, 32, or 64 noteboard beats, depending on tempo. Sometimes, it isn't (see the first break in Foreplay/Long Time for an example). I don't see the two events in the BEAT track doing different things in the gameplay (perhaps different stage lighting or something but nothing that matters for pathing), so I've drawn them all in the same color. If it isn't obvious, you want to look at the small red lines above every set of lines (this also makes a nice seperator for multi-instrument parts). [u]Note that this [b]DOES NOT[/b] affect whammy rate, only usage rate.[/u] Whammy is always based on noteboard beats.
[*][b]Band per-measure scores[/b], more or less. This is currently done "stupidly", and does not include vocals. It is "stupid" because it takes each instrument's per-measure score and multiplies it by the instrument's maximum multiplier, regardless of whether such a multiplier is possible yet at that point. Vocals is on the to-do list and maybe a smarter way of doing it.

[b]FAQ[/b]
(Yes, I have been asked some of these more than once.)

Q. What did you use to make these charts?
A. I wrote a program in PHP to parse the .mid files (using a [url=http://staff.dasdeck.de/valentin/midi/]library[/url]) and coded the rest from there. 

Q. How long does it take to make the charts?
A. I completely revamped my code to do every single chart in one go, so it takes significanly less time than it used to. It also stores the parsed .mid files in a (very large file-size) format which it can read nearly instantaneously, instead of taking several seconds to parse the .mid file every time. For the first batch with 147 songs, it took 42 minutes to parse the files and make guitar, bass, guitar+bass, drums, vocals, voxtar, and full band charts; just generating the images from the cached parses took about 16 minutes.

Q: Can I host a mirror for your charts?
A: I'd really rather you just link to them for now. I don't have any bandwidth issues on my website, and I change them often enough for the time being that it wouldn't be worthwhile. If you absolutely must redistribute them for some reason (f.ex. showing activation points on them), please don't obscure my URL at the bottom of the images.
