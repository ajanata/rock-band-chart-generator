I haven't touched this project in years; I just thought it'd be useful to put it up here. Code is
completely unsupported at this point. The code is pretty messy (of course, it's PHP, so yeah...).

You're going to need this in a directory named 'midi': https://github.com/lightwomb/MIDI-Dev/tree/master/midi_class_v176
And you're going to need the contents of the 'classes' directory of that in the 'classes' directory here (symlink).
This is pretty useless without the .mid files from Rock Band.
